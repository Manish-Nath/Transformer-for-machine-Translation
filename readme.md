# Transformer for Machine Translation

This repository implements a Transformer model for machine translation using PyTorch.

## Overview

The Transformer architecture is a powerful model designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation. This project implements a custom Transformer model to translate between two languages.

## Features

- **Attention Mechanism**: Uses scaled dot-product attention to capture relationships between words in different languages.
- **Positional Encoding**: Injects positional information into the input embeddings.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Classic encoder-decoder structure for translation tasks.
- **Multi-head Attention**: Enhances the model’s ability to focus on different parts of the input.
- **Feed-forward Network**: Each layer has a point-wise feed-forward network to process the output of the attention mechanism.

## Model Architecture

The Transformer model consists of:

1. **Encoder**: Multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks, processing the source sentence.
2. **Decoder**: Layers of masked self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward networks, processing the target sentence.
3. **Positional Encoding**: To provide order information to the model.

## Requirements

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchtext
